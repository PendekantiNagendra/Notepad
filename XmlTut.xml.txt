 		** XML documents create a hierarchical structure looks like a tree so it is known as XML Tree that starts at "the root" and branches to "the leaves".
        			
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>  
<note>  
 <to>Tove</to>  
 <from>Jani</from>  
  <heading>Reminder</heading>  
 <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>  
</note>  
 The first line is the XML declaration. It defines the XML version (1.0) and the encoding used (ISO-8859-1 = Latin-1/West European character set).
 The next line describes the root element of the document (like saying: "this document is a note"):
 The next 4 lines describe 4 child elements of the root (to, from, heading, and body).
 And finally the last line defines the end of the root element.


	** Another Example of XML: Books
File: books.xml

 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<bookstore>  
  <book category="COOKING">  
    <title lang="en">Everyday Italian</title>  
    <author>Giada De Laurentiis</author>  
    <year>2005</year>  
    <price>30.00</price>  
  </book>  
  <book category="CHILDREN">  
    <title lang="en">Harry Potter</title>  
    <author>J K. Rowling</author>  
    <year>2005</year>  
    <price>29.99</price>  
  </book>  
  <book category="WEB">  
    <title lang="en">Learning XML</title>  
    <author>Erik T. Ray</author>  
    <year>2003</year>  
    <price>39.95</price>  
  </book>  
</bookstore>  

The root element in the example is <bookstore>. All elements in the document are contained within <bookstore>.

The <book> element has 4 children: <title>,< author>, <year> and <price>.

		
	** XML Attributes
XML elements can have attributes. By the use of attributes we can add the information about the element.

XML attributes enhance the properties of the elements.

Note: XML attributes must always be quoted. We can use single or double quote.
Let us take an example of a book publisher. Here, book is the element and publisher is the attribute.

	<book publisher="Tata McGraw Hill"></book>  
Or

<book publisher='Tata McGraw Hill'></book>  
Metadata should be stored as attribute and data should be stored as element.

<book>  
<book category="computer">  
<author> A & B </author>  
</book>  
Data can be stored in attributes or in child elements. But there are some limitations in using attributes, over child elements.

		**Difference between attribute and sub-element

In the context of documents, attributes are part of markup, while sub elements are part of the basic document contents.

In the context of data representation, the difference is unclear and may be confusing.

Same information can be represented in two ways:

1st way:

<book publisher="Tata McGraw Hill"> </book>  
2nd way:

<book>  
<publisher> Tata McGraw Hill </publisher>  
</book>  

In the first example publisher is used as an attribute and in the second example publisher is an element. XML attributes must be Quoted.("" or '').

Both examples provide the same information but it is good practice to avoid attribute in XML and use elements instead of attributes.

  ** XML Tree Structure

An XML document has a self descriptive structure. It forms a tree structure which is referred as an XML tree. 
The tree structure makes easy to describe an XML document.

A tree structure contains root element (as parent), child element and so on. 
It is very easy to traverse all succeeding branches and sub-branches and leaf nodes starting from the root.

Example of an XML document
<?xml version="1.0"?>  
<college>  
  <student>  
      <firstname>Tamanna</firstname>  
      <lastname>Bhatia</lastname>  
      <contact>09990449935</contact>  
      <email>tammanabhatia@abc.com</email>  
      <address>  
           <city>Ghaziabad</city>  
           <state>Uttar Pradesh</state>  
           <pin>201007</pin>  
      </address>  
  </student>  
</college>   

  In the above example, first line is the XML declaration. It defines the XML version 1.0. Next line shows the root element (college) of the document.
 Inside that there is one more element (student). Student element contains five branches named <firstname>, <lastname>, <contact>, <Email> and <address>.

<address> branch contains 3 sub-branches named <city>, <state> and <pin>.
Let's see the tree-structure representation of the above example.
